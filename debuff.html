<h2>Debuffs</h2>
<p><b>The formula setup you'll find here is absolutely, without a doubt wrong! I warned you. These are only presented in a mathematical sense out of a really poor sense of aesthetic.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The chance to land a debuff depends on several things with slight variations between them. From personal observations, the chance to land a debuff depends on:</li>
<ul>
<li>One of the base stats affects the chance of resisting a debuff</li>
<ul
<li>CON resists stun and bleed</li>
<li>MEN affects poison, root, sleep resistance and basically everything not covered by another stat.</li>
<li>From experience, base stats do not provide a great amount of resistance to a debuff. There are no exact numbers to provide but you're looking at a 1% or even less difference per point of a base stat in debuff resistance.</li>
</ul>
<li>Magic-based debuffs are affected by both the M.Atk. of the caster and the M.Def. of the target.</li>
<li>The level of the skill affects the chance to land a debuff. I'm calling this Learn Level on L2P. Basically to ensure that a debuff will land, you need to keep the skill leveled up. In general, getting a debuff skill at level 70 will ensure that it lands normally on a target who is level 70, but has a reduced chance on a level 71 or higher and of course an increased chance on a level 69 or lower target. Specifically, it sets an effect multiplier which seems to correlate to a target's level similarly to accuracy & evasion. Skills like shield stun have an extremely high effect multiplier and skills like a tyrant's stun skill have a low multiplier.</li>
<li>Any buff a character might have to resist a specific debuff, such as Resist Shock, Invigor, Mental Aegis, etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>Since little is known about the actual formula for determining debuffs, here is a general outline of how it seems to work:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Resistance would be anything like Armor Set Bonuses, Buffs, Passives, Toggles or such that resistance the debuff in question. There are many different ways to resist various debuffs.</li>
	</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stun - (Base Land Rate/CON Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level)</li>
<li>Physical Bleed - (Base Land Rate/*CON Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level), can be cured by a cure bleed spell.</li>
<li>Magical Bleed - <br>(Base Land Rate/Men Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level)*(M.Atk./M.Def.),<br> cannot be cured.</li>
<li>Poison - (Base Land Rate/Men Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level)*(M.Atk/M.Def.)</li>
<ul>
<li>Viper Cubic ignores any kind of resistance to Poison because the genius who coded the skill forgot to make it poison attribute. It can be cured by Cure Poison skills.</li>
</ul>
<li>Holy Aura - (Base Land Rate/Men Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level); holy aura is not a magical skill</li>
<li>Root/Hold - (Base Land Rate*Men Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level)*(M.Atk./M.Def.)</li>
<li>Physical Slow (Cripple) - (Base Land Rate/Men Modifier)*(Learn Level/Target Level)</li>
<li>Magical Slow - (Base Land Rate/Men Modifier)*(Learn Level/Target Level)*(M.Atk/M.Def.)</li>
<li>Sleep - (Base Land Rate/Men Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level)*(M.Atk./M.Def.)</li>
<li>Paralyze (Base Land Rate/Men Modifier*Resistance)*(Learn Level/Target Level)*(M.Atk./M.Def.)</li>
<li>Misc. - most of the rest like the overlord debuffs are the same as roots</li>
</ul>
<li>Special mention:Cancel</li>
	Pre-Interlude Cancel is (Learn Level/Buff Level), which is why enchanted buffs will turn 76+ and will be harder to resist.
	Interlude Cancel works the same as Sorcerer's Cancel, meaning that all it is resisted ONLY by resistance skills such as Lionheart and Arcane Protection.
