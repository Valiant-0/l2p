<h1>L2P</h1>
<hr>
<p>This will hopefully turn out to be a successful attempt to describe just how the physics in lineage 2 work. We'll see.</p>

Don't bother allowing popups on this site if your browser blocks them as those are only annoying advertisements. If any ads ever show up advertising in game currency sales, report them to me and I will do my best to remove them. I do not tolerate such websites.
<hr>
<h3>Notice</h3>
L2P is incredibly out of date. Most of the principles still work, but there are many additions since the last time L2P was updated.
<hr>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>A mirror of this site is availabe at <a href="https://github.com/Valiant-0/l2p" target=blank>https://github.com/Valiant-0/l2p</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>L2Calc is free to use on your site. Edit it however you see fit, but keep in mind you'd have to re-edit it every time I release a new revision.</br>
</br>
If for some reason you feel the need to use any information from L2P on your site, feel free to do so.</br>
