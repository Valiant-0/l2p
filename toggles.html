<h4>FAQ</h4>

<p><b>Q. Why doesn't it add as much as you said it would on my status window screen?</b></p>
<p>They don't work that way exactly. Oh yes, it does add what I say it does. Just not the way it seems like it would. Confused? Good. Look <a href="basestats.html">here</a href> and follow the links for whatever stat you're looking at.

<p><b>Q. It says the "blah blah HP or MP per tick" is this, but in game it's totally different. Why!</b></p>

<p>The numbers you'll see here are just base values. I do not know the formula for per tick stuff at present. The only exception should be the % changes. Percent changes should be correct as listed but it's still confusing because of the regen formulas.</p>

<p><b>Enchanted skills are located <a href="skillenchant.html">here</a>.</b></p>
